Laser car project. This is a RC car that runs by the code that was uploaded onto it. The final addition to the car was a laser that also works from a code that was custom made by me.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I've stripped away a lot of the parts that were originally on the robot to create room for my kicking arm. I changed the code a lot to accommodate the second H-Bridge which I go more in-depth about in my video below. I've loved this journey so far and I can't wait to see where this takes me in my future career.

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move with a remote controller. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the wiring does and how signals are shared.
