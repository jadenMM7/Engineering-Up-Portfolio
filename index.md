Laser car project. This is a RC car that runs by the code that was uploaded onto it. The final addition to the car was a laser that also works from a code that was custom made by me.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I've imported a working code to make my project move with a remote controller and changed the wiring a lot in order for it to move. I've also soldered wires together and customized a code a lot in order to make the laser work. I've loved working on this project and I can't wait to do more activities like this in the future.

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move with by coding. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk in detail about what the wiring does and how signals are shared.
